At first, I used the print on console function to communicate with the user but I decided to change it to a more user-friendly way with dialog boxes.I considered exception handling because programs that can handle exceptions appropriately are said to be more fault tolerant and robust. It gives the program a more professional finish. Considering it isnâ€™t a formal request for this file, I would like to add that I had never worked with GitHub before. It was completely unknown to me so I had to do my research and learn how to use it quickly. I wrote, tested and changed all my code using Eclipse without saving separate versions of my code. What I am trying to say is that I am totally open to learning new applications, languages. I learn quick, I am adaptable and I am not afraid of new challenges.
